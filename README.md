### **Expense Tracker Script**  

This Python script is a simple **expense tracker** that allows users to add, view, and manage their expenses through a command-line interface. The program provides the following functionalities:  

1. **Adding an Expense** â€“ Users can enter an expense amount and category, which is stored in a list.  
2. **Listing All Expenses** â€“ Displays all recorded expenses with their amount and category.  
3. **Calculating Total Expenses** â€“ Computes and displays the total sum of all recorded expenses.  
4. **Filtering Expenses by Category** â€“ Allows users to filter and display expenses belonging to a specific category.  
5. **Exiting the Program** â€“ Users can exit the application when needed.  

### **How the Code Works**  

- `add_expense(expenses, amount, category)`: Adds a new expense (amount and category) to the list.  
- `print_expenses(expenses)`: Displays all expenses in a structured format.  
- `total_expenses(expenses)`: Calculates and returns the total sum of all expenses.  
- `filter_expenses_by_category(expenses, category)`: Filters and returns only expenses that match a given category.  
- `main()`: Runs an interactive menu allowing users to input and manage expenses dynamically.  

This lightweight program helps users track their spending efficiently within a simple interface. ðŸš€ij
